This article is not really a technical article but more of a list of my favorite tools I use or have used in the past
for various things. I already talked about my favorite [hosting places](/posts/hosting-coding/), my favorite
hacking tools [here](https://dev.nairolf32.com/zer0ne/posts/2022/09/my-favorite-tools/) and more recently
my favorite [game development tools](/posts/game-dev-tools/), now I will talk about the random tools I use in my
everyday life. Prepare for a long list of tools!

# browsers

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my main browser. I know most of you just shrugged but hey,
Google already own my data anyway so why not use their browser? I use it for everything.
I have a lot of extensions installed on it. But I also use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/)
for some things. I like the fact that it's open source.

# Text Editors and Dev utilities

This article is brought to you by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use it for almost everything.
I have a lot of extensions installed on it. [Jetbrains tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/toolbox-app/) especially
[android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for my android projects. Below are some other utilities I might
use:

- [chatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) and other derived AI tools (like everyone else)
- [Codeblocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) (for the legacy)
- [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) (Local testing)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (Mostly for my virtualbox machines)
- [extendsclass](https://extendsclass.com/) (great toolbox for devs)
- [flutter studio](https://flutterstudio.app/) (not really)
- [flutlab](https://flutlab.io/profile) (never used it actually)
- [Buildable](https://app.buildable.dev/home) (it's like zappier)
- [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com)
- [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/nairolf32)
- [notion](https://notion.so/)
- [portmap](https://portmap.io/) (or ngrok)
- [fineVPN](https://finevpn.org/) and [openvpn](https://openvpn.net/)
- [websiteseochecker](https://websiteseochecker.com/)
- [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/)
- [cron-job.org](https://console.cron-job.org/dashboard)
- [code triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) (check it out!)

# Data storage

- [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) for important my document storage
- [Mega](https://mega.nz/) for most stuff
- [onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) because I use windows
- [proton](https://proton.me/fr/drive) for "privacy"

# Media storage

[Google photos](https://photos.google.com/). Now you can say Google own me.
[flickr](https://flickr.com/) is good for some art assets, and [imgur](https://imgur.com/) for the rest.
[imgbb](https://florian-edemessi.imgbb.com/) have the cutest shortened links ever but I don't use it much.
I still don't know how to use [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.fr/) (XD)

# More Google tools

- [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/profile/16394861194423407651)
- [Google sites](https://sites.google.com/)
- [search console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome)
- [cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)
- [play console](https://play.google.com/console/signup) (when I get that money)
and all their other consoles...

Well, that's it for now. I will update this list as I discover new tools. Curation is my passion.
I like Putting things together and making them accessible. I hope you found anything useful here.
