This article is not really a technical article but more of a list of my favorite tools I use or have used in the past
for various things. I already talked about my favorite [hosting places](/posts/hosting-coding/), my favorite
hacking tools [here](https://dev.nairolf32.com/zer0ne/posts/2022/09/my-favorite-tools/) and more recently
my favorite [game development tools](/posts/game-dev-tools/), now I will talk about the random tools I use in my
everyday life. Prepare for a long list of tools!

# browsers

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my main browser. I know most of you just shrugged but hey,
Google already own my data anyway so why not use their browser? I use it for everything.
I have a lot of extensions installed on it. But I also use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/)
for some things. I like the fact that it's open source.

# Text Editors and Dev utilities

This article is brought to you by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use it for almost everything.
I have a lot of extensions installed on it. [Jetbrains tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/toolbox-app/) especially
[android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for my android projects. Below are some other utilities I might
use:

- [chatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) and other derived AI tools (like everyone else)
- [Codeblocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) (for the legacy)
- [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) (Local testing)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (Mostly for my virtualbox machines)
- [flutter studio](https://flutterstudio.app/) (not really)
- [flutlab](https://flutlab.io/profile) (never used it actually)
- [Buildable](https://app.buildable.dev/home) (it's like zappier)
- [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com)
- [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/nairolf32)
- [notion](https://notion.so/)
- [portmap](https://portmap.io/) (or ngrok)
- [fineVPN](https://finevpn.org/) and [openvpn](https://openvpn.net/)
- [websiteseochecker](https://websiteseochecker.com/)
- [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/)
- [cron-job.org](https://console.cron-job.org/dashboard)
- [code triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) (check it out!)

# Data storage

- [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) for important my document storage
- [Mega](https://mega.nz/) for most stuff
- [onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) because I use windows
- [proton](https://proton.me/fr/drive) for "privacy"

# Media storage

[Google photos](https://photos.google.com/). Now you can say Google own me.
[flickr](https://flickr.com/) is good for some art assets, and [imgur](https://imgur.com/) for the rest.
[imgbb](https://florian-edemessi.imgbb.com/) have the cutest shortened links ever but I don't use it much.
I still don't know how to use [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.fr/) (XD)

# More Google tools

- [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/profile/16394861194423407651)
- [Google sites](https://sites.google.com/)
- [search console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome)
- [cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)
- [play console](https://play.google.com/console/signup) (when I get that money)
and all their other consoles...

# Not-so-legal Utilities

Please don't sue me.
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
For educational purposes only.

- [FDM](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/) (A very legal tool for not-so-legal downloads)
- [spotify](https://www.spotify.com/fr/) is very legal for music just like [soundcloud](https://m.soundcloud.com/)
and [Audiomack](https://audiomack.com/) (very important tools) but I don't know about [spotidown](https://spotifydown.com/fr)
and [spotify-downloader](https://spotify-downloader.com/)
- [converto](https://www.converto.io/en70) is based on [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) for videos
- Anything from [nirsoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/) (Actually very useful tools for IT people but their reputation
is often shaded by bad people using them for bad things. Putting them here is not very helpful for their reputation
but hey, Don't do bad things with them)
- [the mega thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread) (I don't know what you are talking about)
I found some very useful places there like [freemediaheckyeah](https://fmhy.net/) [kimcartoon](https://kimcartoon.li/), [voiranime](https://v5.voiranime.com/),
[cinezone](https://cinezone.to/) and [old torrenting places](https://thepiratebay.org/). French torrents are hard to find but I found some good places like [yggtorrent](https://yggtorrent.is/),
[tipiakeries](https://francepirate.gitbook.io/wikitipiak/tipiakeries) and such...
- [fitgirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) and [skidrow](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/) are very good
places for games but I STRONGLY recommend buying games you like if you can afford it.
It helps those poor souls of game devs a lot. [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) usually
have good deals and [epic games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) give some free games every week.
- [wallpapers](https://wallhaven.cc/) (this one is very legit)
- [libgen](http://libgen.rs/) (I just found those books there)
- [sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/) (For science!)


Well, that's it for now. I will update this list as I discover new tools. Curation is my passion.
I like Putting things together and making them accessible. I hope you found anything useful here.
