Challenger (Not LOL related) used to be a repository to display my mediocre competitive programming "skills" and show off a bit (big flex).
But I didn't need a whole repository for that so I Turned it into a simple article on my blog here.
Basically this article will focus on my favorites platforms for competitive programming. You might find
some interresting places to practice too. Buckle up challengers!

## Challenges (Top platforms)

This place is in the "karate" theme (or whatever martial arts use dojos). They call their challenges "katas"
and you level up by solving them. The katas are divided into 8 kyu (beginner) to 1 kyu (master).
The "katas" follow the same ranking of difficulty. This is one of the most famous places to practice your
coding and problem solving skills.

A place for the elite. Your code not only has to work, but it has to be efficient.
This is the place where you can master your algorithms and data structures.
People go there to prepare for job interviews. This is pro level stuff but even you (yes, you!)
can write your mediocre code there and still get away with it.

I recently discovered this one and I like it much. They teach you programming languages.
Basically they have a lot of coding languages which you can practice on or learn (some languages have
a learning mode). The thing goes from well-known languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++ to shady
obscure languages like Elixir, Elm, and ancient scriptures like COBOL. You can also mentor people there
and get mentored.

This one hyped me very much at first but ended up being just "okay".
It's a good place to practice though. They have a lot of challenges and you can also
compete with other people. The arcade mode is a good place to start. Then you can do real challenges
or train for interviews. They also have a "company" section where you can practice for specific companies
interviews like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. This is their special feature.

Ha! Tell me you didn't see this one coming. Hackerrank is the place where you can practice various on-demand
skills. Their thing is certificates that you can get to show off to your friends and family. No seriously,
their certificates are recognized by companies and you can put them on your resume. But I personally think
people don't care much about certificates nowadays, But hey having a hackerrank certificate is a big flex.
