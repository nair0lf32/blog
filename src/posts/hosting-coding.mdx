Now that you learnt how to code, you wonder how you can expose your non-sensical logic-defying
unreadble scribles to the maximum people possible while you make them experience intolerable
amounts of cringe. fret no more my friend! You can now host your code on the internet for little to no
money! I, myself, am a no money person so most of the things I will be talking about will be free.
What tools I do use? where do I put my code? here is the result of years of research!

## Domains üåê

Before we talk about flexing your bad code on people that don't know any better, I want to talk about
domains (no this is not a JJK reference). I won't go deep into the details about what a domain is, or
how important it might be. You can just google that. A domain is not mandatory but having one is always
better. Mine is [nairolf32.com](https://nairolf32.com). It's from [cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
I used to have one on  [namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) but I moved to cloudflare because it's actually
cheaper (ironic) and way more secure. I am not even affiliated with cloudflare I just love their service.
I also get free subdomains everywhere I can, using pages (github, gitlab, bitbucket, cloudflare‚Ä¶),
with wordpress or editors like wix (yuck!) ,
also some from [here](http://freedns.afraid.org/domain/)
and if you want to get a domain I suggest checking [the list](https://tld-list.com/) first.

## Cloud and Vps ‚òÅÔ∏è

I used to have a VPS on [digitalocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) and also tried
[akamai/linode](https://cloud.linode.com/) too but ended up not liking them much...
I recommend digitalocean for cheap VPS though (If you got 5 bucks to spare).
Also considering major cloud providers like Google, Azure, AWS, Oracle...but none seem to be really
"cheap" or "free", and to be honest it's quite understandable.

## Workspaces üìÅ

Now let's talk about where you can actually code. Obviously you know I am gonna say:

### Workspaces with VCS

[Github](https://github.com/) is my main workspace. I use it for everything.
I have a lot of repositories, a lot private for my silly experiments, some public mostly because
I like using their [pages](https://pages.github.com/). I wrote a semi-decent article about git and github
[here](/posts/git-gud/).

To stay in the version control system league we also have:

- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/nair0lf32/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/nair0lf32/)


### other workspaces

There are other places where you can code and store your code without necessarily using VCS

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces)
- [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~nairolf32)
- [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/u/nair0lf32/profile)
- [deta](https://deta.space/?horizon=uXEVDV7tGg)

And if you like containers and CI/CD [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repositories) will hold
your images for you.

## Online Code editors üìù

Now if you don't want to install anything on your computer, but feel the urge to display your
so-called "skills" you can open your browser and code directly there. The magic people from the internet
will take care of the  rest and make sure your code is available to the world. Here are some places
where I usually go:

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/nair0lf32)
- [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/@nair0lf32)
- [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/nairolf32)
- [repl.it](https://replit.com/@nair0lf32)
- [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/fiddles/all/)

## Deployments üöÄ

Basically you have a lot of options to deploy your code but these platforms focus on this exact purpose.
They want to make sure your code is available, fast and secure.
Now you need to pick them according to your needs

### Static (and serverless)

- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [surge](https://surge.sh)
- [glitch](https://glitch.com/@nairolf32)

And any pages (github, gitlab, bitbucket, cloudflare...)

### Dynamic (and serverless)

- [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) used to be free but now it's here just
    because I used to like it. Same for [railway](https://railway.app/)
- [render](https://render.com)
- [000webhost](https://fr.000webhost.com/) (Seriously...it got a terrible reputation but hey...)
- [infinityfree](https://infinityfree.com)
- [awardspace](https://awardspace.net)
- [koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com)
- [qovery](https://qovery.com)
- [Python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/nairolf32/)
- [Anvil](https://anvil.works/)
- [appwrite](https://cloud.appwrite.io/)
- [fly](https://fly.io/)


### web3 (some say it's the future)

- [fleek](https://fleek.xyz/)
- [pinata](https://pinata.cloud/)
- [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/)

More might come in a dedicated article about web3 because I am still a bit confused about it

## Mostly databases üóÑÔ∏è

- [supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
- [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [cockroachdb](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/)
- [atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
- [prisma](https://console.prisma.io/)
- [fauna](https://dashboard.fauna.com/)
- [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)

## Local hosting üè†

Now this is not a very conventional method but hear me out. You can simply host your code on your own computer.
Yes, basically if you know how to setup a Server with port forwarding, and correct DNS and IP configurations,
or how to activate DMZ with all the Security risks that come with it, you can host your code on your own computer.

Or you can also use some tools that expose your local server to the internet through a link. Most of the
time it's a temporary solution to quickly show your work to someone (like a client or your Boss). In this category
we have:
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (the champion)
- [fenix web server](https://preview.fenixwebserver.com/)
- [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/)
- [serveo](https://serveo.net/)
- [pagekite](https://pagekite.net/)
- [localxpose](https://localxpose.io/)
- [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/)
- [tunnelin](https://app.tunnelin.com/)

ngrok comes packed in one of my favorite local development tools [laragon](https://laragon.org/)
(I am not even affiliated to them, they are just that good and need more recognition)

Most importantly anything from [Freefordev](https://free-for.dev/#/?id=paas) and [Freestuff](https://freestuff.dev/).
Now you have all the tools to force people to see your spaghetti code and its results. In upcoming
articles I will talk about more utilities and tools and how I usually set my development environment.
I also plan to talk a bit about game development (we often forget those poor souls). Stay tuned!
