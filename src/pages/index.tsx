        Welcome to my blog...It's powered by <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">gatsby</a> so you know it is <b>great!</b>
        It got a very minimalistic design on purpose, so you can focus on the content.
        I thought using gatsby for a simple blog would be an "overkill"
        as it's a quite powerful static site generator but it was another occasion to learn and oh boy did
        I learn! Now I can say I hate javascript even more and would like to have a word
        with the guy who thought the world needed graphql...
        Anyway, I actually run multiple blogs and this one right here is an attempt
        to centralize all this mess. I will therefore be writing exclusive tech-related (or not) articles here
        and cross-post SOME of them on my other blogging platforms, which are listed below (not very active yet)
      </p>

        <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        And below is what I already started to write about:  </p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dev.nairolf32.com/zer0ne-blog">zer0ne</a>: My Cybersecurity blog</li>
        <li><a href="https://dev.nairolf32.com/mcs">MedicalCheatsheets</a>: A comprehensive knowledge base about medical pathologies</li>
      </ul>

        Ah yes...most importantly for anyone who might actually come across this, I am a terrible
        writer...really...like the worst you might ever heard of. What I am doing here is mostly
        trying to share what I learn and learn technical writing by doing so...
        I am quite open to constructive feedback so feel free to contact me if you have any
        suggestions or if you find any mistakes. Also I am a somewhat busy guy so never expect consistency
        in my writing schedule (this is a freestyle! kek). I write how I feel and when I feel like it.
