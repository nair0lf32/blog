My muthafuckin' blog

## Usage

It's powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/?utm_source=starter&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=minimal-starter-ts) so you know it's magnificient

- after cloning this install deps with `npm install`
- if you have the gatsby CLI (highly recommended): `gatsby develop` gives a preview on `http://localhost:8000` (else use npm)
- to build: `gatsby build`

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Deployed automatically on `netlify` (as `gatsby cloud` is now dead) and production can be accessed [here](blog.nairolf32.com)
