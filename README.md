My muthafuckin' blog

It's powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/?utm_source=starter&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=minimal-starter-ts) so you know it's magnificient

## Usage

- After cloning this install all deps with the usual `npm install` command
  (or `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as updating gatsby broke stuff
  and still not fixed)
- Highly recommended to use Gatsby CLI. You can install it using `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
- `gatsby develop` gives a preview server
- To build use `gatsby build`
- You can also just use npm commands directly to test and build
